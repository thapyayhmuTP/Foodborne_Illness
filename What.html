        <h1>What is foodborne illness?</h1>
        <p>Foodborne illness, commonly known as food poisoning, can be caused by consuming contaminated foods or beverages. 
          Foodborne illnesses can be caused by a wide range of pathogens or disease-causing bacteria that can be found in foods. 
          A virus, such as the norovirus, or bacteria, such as salmonella or E. coli, are the most common causes of food poisoning.
          <br><br>Anyone can acquire food poisoning, but there is a higher risk of serious illness for small children under five, those over 60, and those whose immune systems are compromised.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>The cause of food poisoning</h3>
        <p>Eating something that has been infected with bacteria will result in food poisoning. 
          Food can become contaminated if it is not properly prepared, such as when it is not fully cooked or reheated, when it is not properly frozen or chilled, when it is left out for an extended period of time, when it is handled by someone who is ill or does not wash their hands, or if it is consumed past the "use by" date. 
          Food poisoning can occur from any kind of food.<br><br>
          The majority of foods that have been properly prepared or stored are safe to consume. 
          However, eating contaminated food increases the risk of getting sick or getting infected. 
          Contaminated fruits and vegetables that are not refrigerated can support the growth of harmful germs.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Symptoms of foodborne illness</h3>
        <p>Food poisoning symptoms include: <br><br>
          <i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i> <t> feeling unwell (nausea),</t><br>
          <i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i> <t> diarrhoea,</t><br>
          <i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i> <t> becoming ill (vomiting),</t><br>
          <i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i> <t> stomach pain,</t><br>
          <i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i> <t> having a temperature of 38 degrees or higher,</t><br>
          <i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i> <t> feeling generally ill, such as fatigue or aches and chills.</t><br>
          <br>It usually takes a few days for the symptoms to appear after eating the food that caused the problem. 
          <br><br> There is no guarantee that they will begin immediately or not for several weeks to come.</p>
